# Common-Object-Detection
This is an Object detecting model which identifies a list of objects using Convolutional Neural Networks.
Import the necessary libraries.
Load the data and seperate it into training and testing.
Convert the data type of the pandas dataframe into float type and Normalize the data.
One hot encode the outputs.
Import the necessary layers and Sequential model from Keras.
Construct the model.
Train the necessary model.
Use the model to make predictions in batches.
Show both the predicted output and actual output.
